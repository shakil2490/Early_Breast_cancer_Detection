# Early_Breast_cancer_Detection
Early and accurate detection of breast cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes and survival rates. Current detection methods often face challenges related to accuracy and efficiency. This project aims to address these issues by developing a breast cancer detection system using various machine learning models through PyCaret. By classifying breast tissue samples as malignant or benign, the system enables timely intervention and better patient care.
Objectives
Build a breast cancer detection system using PyCaret.
Compare the performance of different machine learning models.
Accurately classify breast tissue samples as malignant or benign.
Identify the best-performing model for optimal prediction accuracy.

Among the 12 machine learning models tested, Logistic Regression stood out with the highest accuracy of 98.49% and an AUC score of 0.9976. These results highlight its exceptional ability to accurately classify breast tissue samples as either malignant or benign.
